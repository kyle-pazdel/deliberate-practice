// Map an array to a new array with some computation performed on each item

//  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number times 3.
// For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [3, 6, 9].

//  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string upcased.
// For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["HELLO", "GOODBYE"].

//  3. Start with an array of objects and create a new array of string values from each object's :name key.
// For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes ["Alice", "Blane"].

//  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number plus 7.
// For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [8, 9, 10].

//  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's length.
// For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes [5, 7].

//  6. Start with an array of objects and create a new array of number values from each object's :age key.
// For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [27, 16].

//  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number divided by 2.
// For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes [0.5, 1.0, 1.5].

//  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with each string's first letter only.
// For example, ["hello", "goodbye"] becomes ["h", "g"].

// 9.  Start with an array of objects and create a new array of number values from each object's :age key times 2.
// For example, [{name: "Alice", age: 27}, {name: "Blane", age: 16}] becomes [54, 32].

// 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with each number converted into a string.
// For example, [1, 2, 3] becomes ["1", "2", "3"].
