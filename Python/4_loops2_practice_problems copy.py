# Create a loop which modifies a variable each time the loop runs from memory

# 1. Write a while loop to print the numbers 1 through 10.

i = 1
while i <= 10:
  print(i)
  i += 1

# 2. Write a while loop that prints the word "hello" 5 times.

i = 1
while i <= 5:
  print("hello")
  i += 1

# 3. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters the word "stop".

go = True
while go:
  response = input("Enter a word: ")
  if response.lower() == "stop":
    go = False


# 4. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 0 through 100, increasing by 5 each time.

i = 0
while i <= 100:
  print(i)
  i += 5

# 5. Write a while loop that prints the number 9000 ten times.

i = 0
while i < 10:
  print(f"#{i + 1}: 9000")
  i += 1

# 6. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a number and will run forever until the user enters a number greater than 10.

go = True
while go:
  response = input("Enter a number: ")
  if int(response) > 10:
    go = False

# 7. Write a while loop that prints the numbers 50 to 70.

i = 50
while i <= 70:
  print(i)
  i += 1

# 8. Write a while loop that prints the phrase "Around the world" 144 times.

i = 0
while i < 144:
  print(f"#{i + 1}: Around the world")
  i += 1

# 9. Write a while loop that asks the user to enter a word and will run forever until the user enters a word with more than 5 letters.

while True:
  response = input("Enter a word: ")
  if len(response) > 5:
    break

# 10. Write a while loop that prints the even numbers from 2 to 40.

i = 2
while i <= 40:
  print(i)
  i += 2
