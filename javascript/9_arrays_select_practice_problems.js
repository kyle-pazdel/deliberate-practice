// Select items from an array into a new array with items that match a certain condition

//  1. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 20.
// For example, [2, 32, 80, 18, 12, 3] becomes [2, 18, 12, 3].

//  2. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that start with the letter "w".
// For example, ["winner", "winner", "chicken", "dinner"] becomes ["winner", "winner"].

//  3. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices greater than 5 (from the :price key).
// For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}].

//  4. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the even numbers.
// For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [2, 4, 8].

//  5. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings shorter than 4 letters.
// For example, ["a", "man", "a", "plan", "a", "canal", "panama"] becomes ["a", "man", "a", "a"].

//  6. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with names shorter than 6 letters (from the :name key).
// For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

//  7. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the numbers less than 10.
// For example, [8, 23, 0, 44, 1980, 3] becomes [8, 0, 3].

//  8. Start with an array of strings and create a new array with only the strings that don't start with the letter "b".
// For example, ["big", "little", "good", "bad"] becomes ["little", "good"].

//  9. Start with an array of hashes and create a new array with only the hashes with prices less than 10 (from the :price key).
// For example, [{name: "chair", price: 100}, {name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}] becomes [{name: "pencil", price: 1}, {name: "book", price: 4}].

// 10. Start with an array of numbers and create a new array with only the odd numbers.
// For example, [2, 4, 5, 1, 8, 9, 7] becomes [5, 1, 9, 7].
